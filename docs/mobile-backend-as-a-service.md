# Mobile Backend as a Service: Build Mobile Apps in quick time using Snowpal APIs

> saas.snowpal.com: Building a native mobile app takes a fair bit of time for most teams. Our Mobile BaaS will cut that time in half (at the very least).

When we built our first mobile app at Snowpal and launched it on the App and Play stores, we felt a sigh of relief. Yes, we were thrilled to release our first app but at the same time, we felt that we had to do a lot more than we ideally would’ve liked to as plenty of time had to be spent on building boilerplate code and features as none of the foundational elements were readily available.

So, after we launched our apps, we decided to make lives easier for other companies by componentizing our app and equally importantly, making our APIs available for other teams to use. And so our Mobile Backend as a Service was born.

Today, if you are a team that’s looking to build a mobile app, you will have a lot lesser to do if you leveraged what we have. This way, you can most (if not all) of your time in focusing on your core customer problems and solving those.

## What are some of our mobile components you can leverage?

We call them components, loosely speaking, but look at a mobile app as needing several different pieces, and the more pieces of the puzzle you do not have to build yourself, the quicker you can go to market. Our interest is in providing those pieces to you in a seamless fashion.

### UI Components

Our apps are built on the popular cross platform Flutter framework, and you can license our code to give you a head start. Imagine having all the fundamental building blocks of an app so all you really have to do is tweak it to suit your needs. Note that it is not a UI template but is a full fledged app with API Integration. You will get the following reusable components amongst other things:

- Sign In with email and password

- Social Media Sign Ins (Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google)

- Dashboard to show a synopsis of everything that’s happening in your system

- Navigation across numerous screens

- Ability to add Attachments, Checklists, Notes and Comments

- Multilevel Content Hierarchy

- Notifications (including push notifications)

- Conversation UI that supports both Private and Group Conversations

- Relations UI to connect disparate resources

- API Integration with REST Endpoints

- Caching so not all requests end up in API calls

There’s a lot more but that should give you an idea.

### API Integration

We also provide numerous APIs for you to pick and choose from. Even better, the app comes with some of that integration out of the box so all you have to do is do the mapping between your requirements on both the UI and API sides and work towards solving your core customer problems from the get go.

Here’s a list of some of our APIs that you can integrate:

- Building Blocks API: Provides all the foundational building blocks for you to build any app without worrying about server side dependencies. Just plug and play, literally.

- Project Management API: For all your Project Management needs. Build Kanban boards, support bulk actions, collaborate, and more.

- Content Management API: For your Content Management needs. Supports hierarchical content structures that are entirely customizable.

- Classroom API: If you are building EdTech solutions, this should help you hit the ground running with features targeted for Teachers and Students.

- Conversation API: Have a need to support In-App Conversations? Focus on UI/UX by leaving the rest to this API.

- Status API: Build Slack Apps, or Mobile Apps to manage member statuses within and across teams.

- Custom Attribution API: Create forms quickly by adding customized attributes spanning a wide variety of field types.

- Access Control List API: Secure your applications by managing access control on resources seamlessly.

Can you think of any reason why you would not want to use everything that we’ve discussed above, and instead choose to reinvent the wheel? We didn’t think so!
