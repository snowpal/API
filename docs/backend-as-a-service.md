# Backend as a Service: APIs

> Reduce your Time to Market (TTM) by leveraging our APIs.

We've published a variety of APIs with a rich set of endpoints so you can focus on what's important to you (_solving your customers' problems, that is_), and leave the rest of the backend heavy lifting to us. There is a variety of stable and performant products (_Web, Mobile & Server Side Apps_) in Production that leverage these APIs.
