# Getting Started with Snowpal Backend as a Service APIs

Domain-agnostic APIs to build web, mobile or server side apps in quick time. Pick a plan on aws.snowpal.com, or license our products to run in your own infrastructure.

# Overview

Whether you are building a Web App, a Mobile App, or Server Side Components (_or Microservices_), you are bound to have plenty on your plate. But, don't you worry. **We are here to help.**

We've published a variety of APIs (_and there's more in the making)_ with a rich set of endpoints so you can focus on what's important to you - _solving your customer's problems_, and leave the rest (_aka backend heavy lifting_) to us.

# Start Building

Our APIs are hosted on AWS Marketplace (_and other API Hubs_). Once you subscribe to an API, we will send you an API Key & Product Code, and all you have to do at that point is `start building` your products. Everything else on the server side would be pretty much ready to go.

# Existing Products that leverage our APIs

To prove the breadth and stability of some of our APIs, we've built a few products ourselves, and they have been LIVE in Production for many years now.
